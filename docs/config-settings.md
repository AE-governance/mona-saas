# Configuration settings reference

These configuration settings are part of the Mona web app. For more information on how these settings are managed, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-app-settings). You can access these settings at any time by navigating to the Mona admin center (`/admin`), opening the __Mona SaaS configuration settings__ tab, and clicking __Manage configuration settings__.

> ⚠️ __Warning:__ These configuration settings control nearly every aspect of how Mona functions. Most of these settings are automatically configured during Mona setup. Exercise extreme caution when modifying these settings (especially in production). Updating any of these settings will automatically restart the Mona web app.
